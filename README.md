## Building Dependencies

Before you can build the service, you need to install some dependencies on your Linux system.

### Prerequisites

- pthread

To install these dependencies on Debian/Ubuntu-based systems, you can use the following commands:

```bash
sudo apt-get install pthreads


```



## Building and Installing

1. Create a `build` directory in the root of this repository:

   ```bash
   mkdir build
   cd build
   ```

2. Run CMake to configure the build:

   ```bash
   cmake ..
   ```






## Running the Service

1. cd build
./timer_app
